## 🏗️ Implementation Following MONOCODE Principles

### 1. Observable Implementation ✅
- **Structured Logging**: All components include detailed console logging for debugging
- **Clear Naming**: Component names clearly indicate their functionality
- **Metrics Tracking**: Performance monitoring and scroll engagement tracking
- **State Documentation**: All component states are logged with timestamps

### 2. Explicit Error Handling ✅
- **Error Boundaries**: Each section wrapped in ErrorBoundary components
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Fallback UI for component failures
- **Image Error Handling**: Proper error states for image loading
- **Input Validation**: Type-safe props with TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Dependency Transparency ✅
- **Clear Imports**: All external dependencies explicitly declared
- **Version Compatibility**: Uses existing project dependencies (Framer Motion, Next.js)
- **Component Dependencies**: Clear import structure and prop interfaces
- **Build Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing build process

### 4. Progressive Construction ✅
- **Modular Architecture**: Three separate, reusable components
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Each component can be developed independently
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive implementation from smallest screens up
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading and animation optimization

## 🎨 Style Implementation

### Dark Minimalist Theme
- **Primary Background**: `#1a2c28` (Dark forest green)
- **Primary Text**: `#ffffff` (Pure white)
- **Card Background**: `#ffffff` (White cards for contrast)
